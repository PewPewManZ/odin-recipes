    <h1>Slow Cooker Root Beer Pulled Pork</h1>

    <p>
      This simple slow cooker pulled pork recipe is big hit with my family of
      picky eaters. For a spicy kick, mix 1 part Frank's® RedHot® Buffalo sauce
      and 1 part of your favorite mustard-based BBQ sauce. You can use a pork
      loin instead of pork shoulder, if desired. Combine with your favorite BBQ
      sauce and enjoy.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>1 (4 pound) pork shoulder roast</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons coarse kosher salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle root beer</li>
      <li>1 (4 fluid ounce) bottle liquid smoke flavoring, or to taste</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Directions</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Place pork roast in a slow cooker, rub with salt, and pour root beer,
        liquid smoke, and garlic over the top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook on Low for 8 to 10 hours. Remove pork to a bowl. Strain liquid
        through a fine-mesh strainer; discard liquid or save for another use
        (see Editor's Note). Add garlic cloves back to to pork. Shred pork using
        two forks. Serve with your favorite BBQ sauce.
